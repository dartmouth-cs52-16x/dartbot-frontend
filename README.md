***Note***: color scheme is just a placeholder for now; it'll actually end up looking nicer.

### Homescreen 
Right now our homescreen displays an interactive map with an example pin of one of tour sites. There are also three tabs on our navbar which shows the three main components of our dev site: a link to the bios of all of our tour guides, a link to an iframe of the conversation with our bot, and also a link for admins to sign in to view their analytics and also upload and edit any tour guide profiles. Our admin and bio components and containers are configured to hit the API endpoints; however, we are still working on authentication for the bot and making requests to the bots api.
